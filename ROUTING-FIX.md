# 🔧 GitHub Pages Routing Fix Applied

## ✅ **Issue Fixed**
The 404 error on the homepage has been resolved by configuring React Router for GitHub Pages.

## 🛠️ **Changes Made**

### 1. Updated BrowserRouter Configuration
- **File**: `frontend/src/main.jsx`
- **Change**: Added `basename="/FoodieLocal"` to BrowserRouter
- **Why**: GitHub Pages serves the app from `/FoodieLocal/` path, not root

### 2. Redeployed Application
- Built the updated application
- Deployed to gh-pages branch
- Pushed changes to main branch

## 🌐 **Your Site Status**

**Live URL**: https://jacobashirwad07.github.io/FoodieLocal/

### ⏰ **Wait Time**
- **Deployment**: Complete ✅
- **Propagation**: 2-5 minutes for changes to appear
- **Cache**: Clear browser cache if still seeing 404

## 🎯 **What Should Work Now**

✅ **Homepage** loads correctly  
✅ **Navigation** between pages  
✅ **Direct URL access** to any page  
✅ **Browser back/forward** buttons  
✅ **Page refresh** doesn't break routing  

## 🔍 **Test Your Site**

Try these URLs to verify everything works:
- https://jacobashirwad07.github.io/FoodieLocal/ (Homepage)
- https://jacobashirwad07.github.io/FoodieLocal/meals (Meal Discovery)

- https://jacobashirwad07.github.io/FoodieLocal/orders (Order History)

## 🚨 **If Still Seeing 404**

1. **Wait 5 more minutes** for GitHub Pages to update
2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Try incognito/private browsing**
4. **Check the exact URL** - make sure it includes `/FoodieLocal/`

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

When working correctly, you should see:
- **FoodieLocal homepage** with hero section
- **Navigation menu** with working links
- **Responsive design** on mobile
- **No console errors** in browser dev tools
